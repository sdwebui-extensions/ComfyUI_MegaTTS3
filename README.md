## Model Download

- Models and voices need to be manually downloaded and placed in the `ComfyUI\models\TTS` directory:

[MegaTTS3](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/MegaTTS3/tree/main) Download the entire folder and place it in the `TTS` folder.

Create a new `speakers` folder inside the `MegaTTS3` folder. Download all `.wav` and `.npy` files from [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QhcHWcy20JfqWjgqZX1YM3I6i9u4oNlr) and place them in the `speakers` folder.
